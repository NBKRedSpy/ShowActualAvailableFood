[h1]Show Food Availability[/h1]

Adds additional food counters which indicate how much food is freely available.  Specifically, food that is not being used by a "Food Processor" such as a campfire or garden.

This mod can also change the "low food" blink to use a multiplier.  For example, start blinking when there is less than 2x the required food.  This can be enabled in the settings.

[h1]Display Options[/h1]

The following counters can be enabled:
[list]
[*]Total food in all hot pots.
[*]Food that is not the first item on a Food Processor
[*](Default) Food that is not stacked on Food Processor.
[/list]

See [url=#settings]Settings[/url] below.

The first five items on a Composter are excluded from both counts.
